# ✨ Shadow-UI => React Native UI Library

A sleek, customizable, and production-ready **React Native UI Component Library** designed to accelerate app development with beautifully crafted components out of the box. Built with **[Shopify Restyle](https://github.com/Shopify/restyle)** for a flexible and consistent design system, this library helps you build modern, accessible, and themeable interfaces with ease. Inspired by the simplicity of React Native Paper, it empowers you to create consistent, visually appealing UIs across Android and iOS platforms.

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- ✅ Latest version of **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**
- 💻 A machine running **Windows**, **macOS**, or **Linux**
- ⚙️ React Native CLI properly installed and configured

> **Note**: Please complete the official [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) — up to the **“Creating a new application”** step — before proceeding.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to launch your React Native project using this UI component library.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Bundler

Metro is the JavaScript bundler that runs with React Native. To start it, run the following command from the root of your project:

```bash
yarn start
```

Keep Metro running in its own terminal.

### Step 2: Launch Your App

In a **new terminal**, from your project root, run the appropriate command based on your platform:

#### ▶️ Android

```bash
yarn android
```

#### 🍎 iOS

```bash
yarn ios
```

Once the build completes, you should see your app running in the emulator or simulator — with components styled and powered by this library.

> 💡 You can also run your app directly via Android Studio or Xcode if you prefer.
